Language: JAVA 1.8

Usage: 
Please see Calculator interface for usage
and CalculatorImplTest for examples.

Design:
- It is a JAVA application with a Calculator interface 
providing extensibility through various implementations. 
Default implementation - CalculatorImpl - is included.

- The underlying datatype used for computations is BigDecimal. 
This strategy is to preserve the precision of the results.

- The Operator enum contains the operations used and 
the enum class can be extended to include new operations.
